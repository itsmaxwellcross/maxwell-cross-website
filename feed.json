In Day 1, we start building your personal toolkit immediately.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"18\">Finding subdomains is the first step in mapping an attack surface. Why? Because <code data-path-to-node=\"18\" data-index-in-node=\"80\">dev.target.com</code> usually has weaker security than <code data-path-to-node=\"18\" data-index-in-node=\"128\">www.target.com</code>.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"19\">Here is a snippet of the custom <strong data-path-to-node=\"19\" data-index-in-node=\"32\">DNS Enumerator</strong> we build in the full article:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\"><code>def enumerate_subdomains(domain, wordlist):\n    \"\"\"\n    Enumerate subdomains using DNS queries\n    \"\"\"\n    found_subdomains = []\n    \n    with open(wordlist, 'r') as f:\n        subdomains = f.read().splitlines()\n    \n    for subdomain in subdomains:\n        test_domain = f\"{subdomain}.{domain}\"\n        try:\n            answers = dns.resolver.resolve(test_domain, 'A')\n            for rdata in answers:\n                print(f\"[+] Found: {test_domain} -&gt; {rdata}\")\n                found_subdomains.append(test_domain)\n        except dns.resolver.NXDOMAIN:\n            pass  # Subdomain doesn't exist\n        except Exception as e:\n            pass  # Other DNS errors\n    \n    return found_subdomains</code></pre>\n<p>This simple logic allows us to find the hidden doors into an organization's network.
