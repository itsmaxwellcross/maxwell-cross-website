<p data-path-to-node="12">Today, we take every tool we built in Week 1—from Reconnaissance to Post-Exploitation—and fuse them into a single, automated attack engine.</p>

<p data-path-to-node="11">Yesterday, you gained your first foothold. But this is the moment where most attacks fail.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="12">The difference between a professional Red Teamer and a script kiddie isn't the exploit they used—it's what happens in the first 15 minutes <i data-path-to-node="12" data-index-in-node="139">after</i> the shell pops. Do you panic and run loud commands? Or do you methodically map your surroundings?</p>
<p data-path-to-node="13">Today, we cover <strong data-path-to-node="13" data-index-in-node="16">Situational Awareness</strong>: the art of understanding where you are, what you control, and how to move deeper without tripping every alarm in the SOC.</p>
<hr>
<h3 data-path-to-node="15"><strong data-path-to-node="15" data-index-in-node="0">A Glimpse of the Code: Shell Stabilization</strong></h3>
<p data-path-to-node="16">We've all been there: you get a reverse shell, you type <code data-path-to-node="16" data-index-in-node="56">Ctrl+C</code> to stop a command, and you accidentally kill your own connection.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="17">In Day 6, we build a <strong data-path-to-node="17" data-index-in-node="21">Shell Stabilizer</strong> that automatically upgrades "dumb" shells into fully interactive TTY sessions. Here is the Python logic that saves your session:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>def linux_stabilization(self):
    """
    The 'Python PTY' trick to stabilize a reverse shell.
    Run this inside your victim shell to get a proper terminal.
    """
    commands = [
        # Spawns a pseudo-terminal (PTY) so tools like 'su' and 'sudo' work
        'python3 -c \'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")\'',
        
        # Background the shell (Ctrl+Z), then run this on your machine:
        'stty raw -echo; fg',
        
        # Reset the terminal to fix formatting
        'export TERM=xterm'
    ]
    return commands</code></pre>
<p>This simple technique gives you tab completion, command history, and the ability to run interactive tools like <code data-path-to-node="19" data-index-in-node="111">vim</code> or <code data-path-to-node="19" data-index-in-node="118">nano</code> on the victim machine.</p>

<p data-path-to-node="17">We aren't just covering theory. In Day 1, we start building your personal toolkit immediately.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="18">Finding subdomains is the first step in mapping an attack surface. Why? Because <code data-path-to-node="18" data-index-in-node="80">dev.target.com</code> usually has weaker security than <code data-path-to-node="18" data-index-in-node="128">www.target.com</code>.</p>

    for subdomain in subdomains:
